## Schematic

![schematic](./assets/images/schematic.png)

The microcontroller is shown in the center of the schematic. The voltage regulator circuit is shown in top left, with the programming header for the snap programmer to its right. Below those are the daisy chain headers and breakout headers for the remaining IO pins. The photoresistor comparator circuit is depicted in the bottom left. The three sensors are shown on the right side of the schematic and are all connected through the I2C lines to the microcontroller.  
The schematic lacks debugging lights as any debugging can be done through one of the 12 IO pins on the breakout headers.
